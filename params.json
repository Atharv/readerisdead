{"name":"Reader is Dead","tagline":"A collection of tools to help with the Google Reader shutdown","body":"## Installation and requirements\r\n\r\nAll tools are written in Python and have been tested with Python 2.7 on Mac OS X 10.8. To install them, download either the [`.zip`](https://github.com/mihaip/readerisdead/zipball/master) or [`.tar`](https://github.com/mihaip/readerisdead/tarball/master) archive. Expand the archive, and then open the resulting directory in your terminal. Command lines to invoke specific tools are listed below.\r\n\r\nOn Windows, you'll probably need to [download Python](http://www.python.org/download/) first. Then right-click the folder that you got when you expanded the `.zip`, and choose \"Open command window here\". Once you have a command-line, you can run the same scripts that are mentioned below, but add a `.bat` extension to the script name (e.g. `bin\\reader_archive.bat` instead of `bin/reader_archive`).\r\n\r\n## reader_browser\r\n***Still under development***\r\n\r\n_Browse an archived Google Reader account._\r\n\r\nTakes an archive generated by `reader_archive` and provides a browsing UI for it.\r\n\r\nTo use it:\r\n\r\n```\r\nbin/reader_browser ~/Downloads/reader_archive\r\n```\r\n\r\nThen load http://localhost:8071/ in your web browser (the script will attempt to do automatically) to see the contents of the archive.\r\n\r\n## item_lookup\r\n\r\n_Look up an item in an archived Google Reader account._\r\n\r\nTakes an archive generated by `reader_arhive` and provides a command-line UI for examining items within it.\r\n\r\nTo use it:\r\n\r\n```\r\nbin/item_lookup --archive_directory=~/Downloads/reader_archive 0306277b9d275db1\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe tool will then list all of the streams that the item appears in, the item body, and any comments made on that item. You can provide multiple item IDs (as additional command line arguments).\r\n\r\n## Archived Tools\r\n\r\nNow that Google Reader has been shut down, some of the initial tools (focused on getting the data out) are no longer useful. They were:\r\n\r\n* [`reader_archive`](https://github.com/mihaip/readerisdead/wiki/reader_archive): Saved a comprehensive archive of a Google Reader account.\r\n* [`feed_archive`](https://github.com/mihaip/readerisdead/wiki/feed_archive): Saved public feed data from Google Reader's feed cache.","google":"UA-42093314-1","note":"Don't delete this file!
